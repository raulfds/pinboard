## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated red (#D11A2A) to evoke feelings of stress, frustration, and the act of 'venting'.
- Background color: Very light red (#F5E6E8) for contrast with the primary, while remaining in the same 'venting' conceptual space.
- Accent color: Analogous orange (#D1731A) for secondary emphasis.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), for both headlines and body text.
- Use icons related to films and reasons for pin giving. All icons will be in 2D and match primary color.
- Clean and organized layout with clear sections for pin history, leaderboard, and avatar store.
- Subtle animations for giving pins and changing avatars.
